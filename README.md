# Elevator management system

The automatic elevator system is a c# application created to solve the real world problem. This is developed by using the concepts, principles and techniques of object oriented programming. The goal is to create the fully functional two floor lift system with a control panel. The control panel controls the status and request buttons at each floor. The elevator is made in a such a way that the doors have to be closed during the lift session to prevent from the accident and they must be opened after the user reach to the destination floor. Moreover, the doors must open for a particular period of time and must be user friendly.


## Description

The automatic elevator system is design in such a way that it has two floors named floor1 and floor2.The elevator inside controller contains two buttons 1 and 2. When the user clicks button 1 elevator moves to the floor 1 and when button 2 is pressed elevator heads towards floor number 2. There is also the label which can show that in which floor the elevator is in. Below that there an automatic elevator log. Which slows the information of elevator state and arrived date with time at the particular floor. In the right side top one is the floor number 2 and bottom one is the floor number 1. If the lift is in second floor, by pressing the down arrow beside the lift door, the doors will be automatically opened and closed after the few seconds. Then it will move lift down to the first floor. Same continues for floor 1 as well.
